## Adding support for another editor

Depending on how plugins for your editor work, you can either make the repo
itself work as a plugin (as the Vim plugin is built), or make use of the
`import_js` gem (which also comes with command-line utilities):

```bash
gem install import_js
```

All editor plugins will need to implement an `ImportJS::FooEditor` class. Look
at the one implemented by the Vim plugin (`ImportJS::VIMEditor`), or the Emacs
plugin (`ImportJS::EmacsEditor`) for inspiration. The Vim editor class works as
a reference implementation. Any public methods defined for that class will have
to be implemented in all editor classes.

## Testing

import-js uses RSpec to test its behavior. To run tests, you might first have
to install the `rspec` gem:

```bash
gem install rspec
```

Once you have RSpec installed, you just type `rspec` in the root folder of the
project to run all tests.

```bash
тиа rspec

## Developing for Vim

Here are a few tips to make it simpler to test a local copy of import-js in
Vim:

### Symlink

Make a symlink inside your pathogen bundles folder to the local copy of
import-js to make it easier to try out your changes.

```bash
ln -s ~/import-js import-js
```
